really consider that this parser gonna have a lot of work.. 
look at our analyzer, for just typescript how many thing we added.

it was a bit disappointment, i was thinking with tree-sitter i can easily parse languages and language features like we added does not required much but the reality is not like that.


TypeScript Extractor Complexity
Just for functions, we had to manually implement:

Parameter extraction with types ((id: number, optional?: string))
Return type parsing (Promise<User | null>)
Generic parameter detection (<T, U>)
Async/await detection
Arrow function vs regular function distinction
Export status (export function vs function)
Decorator parsing (@decorator)
Optional parameter handling (param?:)

And that's just functions! For a complete TypeScript analyzer, we'd still need:

Interface inheritance (extends, implements)
Complex type unions (string | number | null)
Conditional types (T extends U ? X : Y)
Mapped types ({ [K in keyof T]: U })
Template literal types
Module declaration parsing
Namespace handling
JSX component analysis
And dozens more TypeScript-specific features...

The Tree-sitter Reality Check
What Tree-sitter gives you:
python# Tree-sitter says: "Here's a function_declaration node"
# with child nodes: type_parameters, formal_parameters, return_type
What you still have to build:
python# You have to write code to understand:
# - What those type_parameters mean semantically
# - How parameters relate to each other
# - What export patterns look like
# - How generics constrain types
# - What decorators do to function behavior
Tree-sitter is "just" a syntax parser - it gives you the AST structure, but you still need a semantic analyzer for each language.
Scaling This to Multiple Languages
If we want to support Python, Java, Go, Rust, etc. with the same depth:
Python would need:

Decorator stacking analysis (@property @cached)
Type hint parsing (Union[Dict[str, Any], None])
Context manager detection (with statements)
Metaclass understanding
Generator/async generator distinction
Import alias tracking

Java would need:

Annotation parameter parsing (@Service("userService"))
Generic bounds (T extends Comparable<T>)
Interface vs abstract class distinction
Checked exception declarations
Package structure analysis

Each language = months of work to get to the TypeScript level of detail.
Potential Strategies to Reduce the Work
1. Start with "Good Enough" Universal Extraction
python# Maybe we don't need full semantic analysis for every language
# Basic "there's a function named X at line Y" might be sufficient initially
2. Community/Crowd-source Language Extractors

Open source the extractor framework
Let language experts contribute their own extractors
We provide the infrastructure, others provide language expertise

3. Focus on High-Impact Languages First

TypeScript/JavaScript (web development)
Python (AI/data science)
Go (cloud/infrastructure)
Rust (systems)
Skip the long tail until there's demand

4. Use AI to Bootstrap Extractors

Use LLMs to generate initial extractor implementations
Have them analyze Tree-sitter grammars and suggest semantic patterns
Human review and refinement

5. Tiered Complexity Levels
pythonLevel 1: Basic (function/class names, locations) - 1 week per language
Level 2: Typed (parameters, return types) - 1 month per language  
Level 3: Advanced (generics, decorators, etc.) - 3+ months per language
The Harsh Truth
You're experiencing what every code analysis tool discovers:
Tree-sitter solves ~20% of the problem (parsing syntax)
Language-specific semantic analysis is ~80% of the work
This is why tools like:

Language servers take years to mature
IDE support varies wildly by language
Static analysis tools are often language-specific
Code intelligence is still an unsolved problem at scale

But... Is It Still Worth It?
Despite the complexity, what you've built has real value:

Clean Architecture: The layered approach means new languages can start simple and get enhanced over time
Progressive Enhancement: Even basic extraction (just function names and locations) is useful
Extensible Foundation: Once you have the framework, adding features is incremental
Market Reality: Most code intelligence tools are single-language or have very uneven multi-language support

Maybe the strategy is to:

Go deep on 2-3 languages (TypeScript, Python, Go?)
Go basic on many languages (just structure, no semantics)
Let usage patterns guide where to invest the semantic analysis work

Your disappointment is totally justified - this is way more work than it seems like it should be!
