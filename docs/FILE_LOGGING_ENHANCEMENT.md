# File Logging Enhancement for analyzer_aware Flow

## Summary

The analyzer_aware flow has been enhanced with file counting and progress tracking that provides visibility into which files are being processed during indexing.

## What Changed

### Before
- No visibility into which files were being processed
- No easy way to know how many files were indexed
- No progress indication during processing

### After
- Pre-scan shows total file count before processing starts
- Each file is logged with progress counter: `[1/25] Processing file...`
- Files grouped by extension in the initial summary

## Implementation Details

### 1. Pre-scan File Counting
The flow now scans for files before processing to provide an upfront count:
```python
# Pre-scan output example:
Found 25 files to process
Files by extension: {'.js': 10, '.py': 8, '.ts': 5, '.tsx': 2}
```

### 2. Progress Tracking
Each file shows its position in the processing queue:
```
[1/25] Processing file: src/index.ts [Language: typescript]
[2/25] Processing file: src/utils.js [Language: javascript]
[3/25] Processing file: tests/test_main.py [Language: python]
...
```

### 3. Why Not Count in the Data Source?
CocoIndex uses lazy/streaming processing for efficiency. The `LocalFile` source doesn't load all files into memory at once - it streams them one by one. This is great for handling large codebases but means we can't get a count from the source directly. Our pre-scan provides this visibility without breaking the streaming model.

## Getting File Counts

Since the file information is stored in the database, you can get file counts using SQL queries:

```sql
-- Total unique files
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT filename) as total_files
FROM code_chunks_with_metadata;

-- Files by language
SELECT language, COUNT(DISTINCT filename) as file_count
FROM code_chunks_with_metadata
GROUP BY language
ORDER BY file_count DESC;

-- Files by extension
SELECT
    SUBSTRING(filename FROM '\.([^.]+)$') as extension,
    COUNT(DISTINCT filename) as file_count
FROM code_chunks_with_metadata
GROUP BY extension
ORDER BY file_count DESC;
```

## Benefits

1. **Real-time visibility**: See which files are being processed as the indexing runs
2. **Language detection feedback**: Confirm that files are being correctly identified
3. **Debugging aid**: Helps identify if certain files are being skipped or misidentified
4. **Simple implementation**: Uses CocoIndex's transform pattern without complex state management

## Testing

Run the test script to see the file logging in action:
```bash
python test_file_logging.py
```

This will create a test project with sample files and show the logging output.
