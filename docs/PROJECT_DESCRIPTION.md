# OUR PURPOSE
## Summary

Over the past few turns, we’ve defined your goal—to build a real‑time, syntax‑aware index of one or more codebases—and chosen the exact tools and language to make it happen. You’ll use **Tree‑sitter** for parsing TypeScript (and any other languages) into ASTs and **CocoIndex’s Python SDK** to orchestrate file ingestion, syntactic chunking, embedding or indexing, and retrieval. Below is a step‑by‑step recap of our conversation, followed by a clear plan for how to proceed.

---

## 1. Conversation Recap

1. **Initial goal**
   You wanted to build a TypeScript parser project using Tree‑sitter, scanning an entire codebase into memory and querying it by symbols, methods, etc.

2. **Tree‑sitter setup**
   I explained how to install and configure Tree‑sitter (and the TypeScript grammar via `tree-sitter-language-pack`) in Node.js or Rust, recursively parse `.ts/.tsx` files, and run S‑expression queries to capture function and method definitions.

3. **Global symbol index**
   We discussed building an in‑memory symbol table by running Tree‑sitter queries on each parsed tree and mapping symbol names to source locations, with examples inspired by CodeQA and CocoIndex.

4. **Existing tools overview**
   I highlighted three open‑source projects:

   * **CodeQA** (Python + embeddings + Tree‑sitter)
   * **CocoIndex** (Rust core + Python SDK + incremental Tree‑sitter chunking)
   * **Dossier** (CLI for JSON summaries of TS code via Tree‑sitter)

5. **CocoIndex TypeScript support**
   You asked whether CocoIndex “just works” on TypeScript out of the box. I confirmed that its Rust engine bundles the TypeScript/TSX grammars and you only need to include `*.ts`/`*.tsx` in your Python flow’s file patterns—no extra parser code required.

6. **Code‑embedding example**
   We reviewed the `examples/code_embedding` folder in the CocoIndex repo, which shows how to:

   * Chunk code with `SplitRecursively()`
   * Create vector embeddings (via SentenceTransformer)
   * Store embeddings in PostgreSQL with `pgvector`
   * Query interactively in a Python REPL

7. **Language choice**
   You asked whether you must use Python for your project or if you could remain in TypeScript. We concluded:

   * **Python**: first‑class SDK, minimal boilerplate, all examples and docs target Python
   * **TypeScript**: you can parse and chunk code natively with Tree‑sitter but would need to bridge into CocoIndex’s Python CLI or build a custom FFI layer for indexing and retrieval

---

## 2. What We Want to Achieve

* **Goal:** A live, queryable index of one or more codebases (initially TypeScript, but extensible) that supports symbol search, code retrieval, and incremental updates as files change.

---

## 3. Tools and Technologies

1. **Tree‑sitter**

   * Parse source files into ASTs
   * Run S‑expression queries to extract symbols, methods, classes
   * Incrementally re‑parse on file changes

2. **CocoIndex (Python SDK)**

   * Define “flows” that ingest files, chunk them syntax‑aware, produce embeddings or token indexes
   * Incremental pipeline with real‑time updates
   * Built‑in support for exporting to databases (Postgres/pgvector) or serving via CLI

3. **Python 3.11+**

   * The official CocoIndex SDK supports Python 3.11–3.13
   * Leverage rich ecosystem for embeddings, databases, and orchestration

4. **PostgreSQL + pgvector** (optional)

   * Store vector embeddings for similarity search
   * Alternatively, use a full‑text index or other back end

---

## 4. How to Proceed: Step‑by‑Step Plan

1. **Set up your Python environment**

   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   pip install cocoindex python-dotenv
   ```

2. **Create a flow definition**
   In `src/code_sitter/flows/basic.py`, use the SDK to:

   ```python
   from cocoindex import FlowBuilder, sources, functions

   flow = FlowBuilder("CodeIndex")
   files = flow.add_source(
     sources.LocalFile(
       path=".",
       included_patterns=["*.ts", "*.tsx"],
       excluded_patterns=["**/node_modules", ".*"],
     )
   )

   def extract_ext(fn: str) -> str:
       import os
       return os.path.splitext(fn)[1]

   files["ext"] = files["filename"].transform(extract_ext)
   files["chunks"] = files["content"].transform(
       functions.SplitRecursively(),
       language=files["ext"],
       chunk_size=1000,
       chunk_overlap=200,
   )
   ```

3. **Configure storage or embedding**

   * **For symbol lookup only:** collect the chunk metadata (file path, node range, text) and insert into a simple database table for exact or prefix search.
   * **For semantic search:**

     ```python
     from sentence_transformers import SentenceTransformer
     embedder = SentenceTransformer("all-MiniLM-L6-v2")

     @flow.register_op
     def code_to_embedding(chunk: str):
         return embedder.encode(chunk).tolist()

     files["emb"] = files["chunks"]["text"].transform(code_to_embedding)
     flow.add_sink(
       flow.sinks.Postgres(
         table_name="code_index",
         columns=["filename", "chunk_index", "text", "embedding"],
         vector_column="embedding",
       )
     )
     ```

4. **Run and monitor your flow**

   ```bash
   cocoindex update src/code_sitter/flows/basic.py
   # Or for better multi-language support:
   cocoindex update src/code_sitter/flows/simple.py
   cocoindex server src/code_sitter/flows/simple.py  # optional: launches a REST API for interactive queries
   ```

5. **Interactive querying**
   Use the built‑in CLI or REST endpoints to:

   * Search by symbol name (exact match on `text` field)
   * Perform k‑NN queries on `embedding` via `pgvector` or your chosen vector store

6. **Incremental updates on file changes**

   * CocoIndex’s watcher will detect edits under your source path and re‑run only the affected parts of the pipeline, keeping the index fresh in real time.

---

With this plan, you’ll leverage Tree‑sitter for precise, syntax‑aware chunking and CocoIndex’s Python SDK for a turnkey indexing and retrieval pipeline—delivering instant, incremental search over your TypeScript (or mixed‑language) codebases.
