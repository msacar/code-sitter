# File Count Logging Implementation Summary

## Changes Made to analyzer_aware Flow

### 1. Pre-scan File Counting
- Added upfront file scanning using `Path.glob()` to count files before processing
- Shows total file count and breakdown by extension
- Respects the same exclusion patterns as the CocoIndex source

### 2. Progress Tracking
- Added `_progress_counter` global to track processing progress
- Created `log_file_with_progress()` function that shows `[current/total]` format
- Each file logs as: `[1/25] Processing file: src/index.ts [Language: typescript]`

### 3. Why This Approach?
- **CocoIndex uses lazy/streaming processing**: The `LocalFile` source doesn't load all files at once
- **Pre-scan provides visibility**: We scan files separately to get counts without breaking the streaming model
- **Progress tracking helps with large codebases**: Users can see how far along the indexing is

## Example Output

```
Searching for files with patterns: ['**/*.ts', '**/*.tsx', '**/*.js', '**/*.jsx', '**/*.py']
Found 156 files to process
Files by extension: {'.js': 45, '.jsx': 23, '.py': 31, '.ts': 42, '.tsx': 15}
[1/156] Processing file: src/components/Button.tsx [Language: typescript]
[2/156] Processing file: src/utils/helpers.js [Language: javascript]
[3/156] Processing file: tests/test_main.py [Language: python]
...
[156/156] Processing file: scripts/build.js [Language: javascript]
Data exported to PostgreSQL table: code_chunks_with_metadata
Code indexing complete!
```

## Benefits

1. **Immediate feedback**: Know how many files will be processed before starting
2. **Progress visibility**: See current progress during long indexing operations
3. **Extension breakdown**: Understand the composition of your codebase
4. **No performance impact**: Pre-scan is fast and doesn't affect streaming processing

## Files Modified

- `src/codesitter/flows/analyzer_aware.py` - Added pre-scan and progress tracking
- `docs/USING_ANALYZER_FLOWS.md` - Updated documentation
- `docs/FILE_LOGGING_ENHANCEMENT.md` - Created detailed feature documentation
- `test_file_logging.py` - Updated test script
- `example_file_counting.py` - Created demonstration script

## SQL Queries for File Statistics

After indexing, you can analyze file counts using:

```sql
-- Total unique files
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT filename) FROM code_chunks_with_metadata;

-- Files by language
SELECT language, COUNT(DISTINCT filename) as file_count
FROM code_chunks_with_metadata
GROUP BY language
ORDER BY file_count DESC;
```
